# hello-world
a hello world rep

This is my first repository. Used to practice and get insight in using Git, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

First, I learned programming in python. I'm interested in machine learning and applying programming tools to urban solutions.
Making robots is my dream.

Now I'm learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to have insights and be able to design for the web.

My goal this year is to become a "full stack" Designer. Gaining insights about technology, UX/UI Design and Digital Product Management is my next goal.
