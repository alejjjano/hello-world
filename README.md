I like programming in python. I'm interested in machine learning and applying programming skils to urban solutions.
Making robots is my dream.

Now i'm learining HTML, CSS and javascript to have insights and be able to design for the web.

My goal this year is to become a "full stack" Designer. Gaining insights about technology, UX/UI Design and Digital Product Management is my next goal.
